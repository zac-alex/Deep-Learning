# Basics of Deep Learning

This repository provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts of deep learning. In this tutorial, we'll cover key topics including the Perceptron, Activation Functions, Backpropagation, Multilayer Perceptron, Epochs, Batches, Learning Rate, Forward Propagation, and Loss Functions. These concepts form the building blocks of deep neural networks, and understanding them is crucial for diving into more advanced deep learning topics.

## 1. Perceptron

The **Perceptron** is one of the simplest types of neural networks. It's a single-layer neural network that is used for binary classification. In this section, we'll introduce the Perceptron model and explain how it works by making predictions based on weighted inputs and an activation function.

- Understanding the structure of a perceptron
- How it processes inputs and produces an output
- Limitations of a single-layer perceptron

## 2. Activation Functions

Activation functions play a crucial role in neural networks by determining how the signal is passed through the network. Without activation functions, the network would simply perform linear transformations, regardless of the number of layers.

- Common activation functions: Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU
- How they introduce non-linearity into the network
- The importance of differentiable activation functions for learning

## 3. Backpropagation

**Backpropagation** is the algorithm used to update the weights in a neural network during training. It calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight by applying the chain rule, and then adjusts the weights accordingly to minimize the loss.

- The process of backpropagation
- How the error is propagated backward through the network
- Calculating gradients and updating weights

## 4. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

A **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** is a neural network with multiple layers of neurons, which allows it to model more complex relationships in data. Unlike the single-layer perceptron, MLPs can learn non-linear decision boundaries.

- Introduction to multiple layers of neurons
- How MLPs work with hidden layers
- Benefits of MLPs over perceptrons

## 5. Epochs, Batches, and Learning Rate

During training, the network needs to adjust its weights to minimize the error. This process involves iterating over the training data multiple times. In this section, we'll discuss the key concepts involved in training:

- **Epochs**: The number of times the entire dataset is passed through the network
- **Batches**: The subset of data used in each iteration
- **Learning Rate**: The step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of the loss function

## 6. Forward Propagation

**Forward Propagation** is the process where input data is passed through the network to make a prediction. Each layer of the network applies its weights and activation function to the input until the output layer produces a result.

- How input data flows through the network
- The role of weights, biases, and activation functions in forward propagation

## 7. Loss Function

The **Loss Function** measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. The goal of training a neural network is to minimize the value of the loss function. In this section, we'll explain the different types of loss functions used in deep learning.

- Common loss functions: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Cross-Entropy Loss
- How the loss function helps guide the optimization process
- The relationship between loss functions and backpropagation

## Conclusion

By understanding these fundamental concepts, you'll have a solid foundation for diving deeper into neural networks and deep learning. As you continue to explore more complex architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), these basics will serve as the building blocks for your learning journey.
