# Activation Functions

The activation function is a key mathematical function used in neural networks to decide if a neuron should be activated or not. It takes the weighted sum of the neuron’s inputs, processes them, and calculates a new value that determines how much signal gets passed on to the next layer in the network. In simpler terms, it controls how strongly a neuron reacts to the input values.

This function is essential for training neural networks because it helps the network model complex, non-linear relationships. Choosing the right activation function for the network architecture and the specific data can greatly impact the performance and outcomes of the model, making it a critical part of building a neural network.

A linear function can be thought of as a basic activation function that simply multiplies the input by a constant 
c, such as 𝑐×𝑥. When c=1, it becomes the identity function. However, this linear function doesn’t introduce any non-linearity to the neural network.

Non-linearity is essential in neural networks because, without it, even networks with multiple layers would only produce linear outputs, no matter how many layers are added. Since most real-world data is not linearly separable, adding non-linear layers helps transform the data in a way that allows the network to learn more complex patterns and use various objective functions effectively.

Now if you look into the above plot,you can see that there is no way you can seperate two classes A & B using a straight line.In other words this data is not linearly seperable.
That is exactly where activation functions comes into play.
